This is an implementation of the Asynchronous Dual Port RAM. It enables the left and right ports to raise read and write requests on the negative edge of the Port Enable signals. The input data and address are pre-loaded and then the write enable is set. Similarily, the target address is pre-loaded and then the read enable is set. Both of the enable pins are active low. Once they are set, the respective request is completed on the negative edge of the port enable signal. The Data arbitration logic prefers the left port in case both of the write requests are made at the exact same instant. Otherwise, if read and write are performed at the same address at the same time, then writing is given the preference and the latest value is read.<br />
The following diagram explains the whole procedure and arbitration logic: ![BLOCK_RAM](https://github.com/shrutipgupta/System-Verilog-for-Verification/blob/master/ASYNC_DUAL_PORT_RAM/ASYNCH_BLK_RAM.PNG)
